* Fix endianness (colours are off): Finished! On the one hand, was the pixel editor (use GIMP from now on); and the bit-shift was wrong on `drawColumn`.
* Implemented mouse look!
- Refactor code to make it more manageable.
- Fix collision detection
- Implemented scaled text raster
- FPS counter
- Improve rotation factor, should feel fine!
